    <h1> Mangos </h1>

    <p> <strong style="color: green;"> Rating: 10/10 </strong>: Starting off strong, we have mangos. The sweet, juicy delicacy that just screams summer. It's one of the most versatile fruits. You can use it in appetizers, to desserts, to just eating it by itself. This fruit can be enjoyed in any imaginable way. For a snack, you can put it in salsas or sauces to make a dip. For a sweet treat, you can make mango float or mango sago. Or if you are feeling a little lazy, you can slice up mangos and eat them as is. One way I used to eat mangos when I was younger was with rice and salt, sooooo good. </p>
    
    <h1> Bananas </h1>

    <p> <strong style="color: orange;"> Rating: 6/10 </strong>: Bananas. Bananas... This one may be controversial. I hate the actual fruit. I have to physically force myself to eat a banana. The texture is not it. It's mushy and gross. I will never get bananas on my acai bowl. However, I will admit the flavor is nice. I like bananas in other food items. I love banana bread pudding and banana bread. Smoothies with bananas and banana milk are pretty good as well. Banana matcha is sooooo delicious. It's just something about the texture of the bananas that make me despise it. If I were to be starving and the only thing to eat was a banana, I would starve. </p>
